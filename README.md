# Butia v4 MakeCode Extension

> A MakeCode extension for the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) platform that brings the **Butia v4 educational robotics kit** into the classroom — enabling students to program real robots using drag-and-drop blocks, with no prior coding experience required.

## Overview

Butia v4 is an **open-source educational robotics platform** aimed at introducing programming and computational thinking to students of all ages. This repository provides a custom [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) extension that exposes Butia v4 hardware capabilities — motors, sensors, and actuators — as intuitive visual blocks in the MakeCode block editor.

Built on top of [Microsoft PXT](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt), the extension is designed to lower the barrier to entry for robotics education: teachers can integrate it directly into existing MakeCode projects without any additional tooling, and students can start programming their robots within minutes.

> **Note:** This extension is being developed as part of a Computer Engineering thesis at the Faculty of Engineering, Universidad de la República (Uruguay). The block API may evolve between versions during active development.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | v24.15.0 | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) — earlier versions may not work |
| npm | bundled with Node.js | Used to install dev dependencies |
| PXT CLI | latest | Install via `npm install -g pxt` |
| Git | any | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/butia4/butia-microbit-extension.git
cd butia-microbit-extension
```

### 2. Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dev tools (TypeScript, ESLint, pxt-microbit) and automatically creates `node_modules/pxtcli.json`, which the `pxt` CLI needs to locate its runtime. Without this step, all `pxt` commands will fail.

---

## Development Workflow

The recommended cycle for developing and testing changes:

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles all TypeScript sources and produces a flashable binary at `built/binary.hex`.

### Test

```bash
npm test
```

Runs the test suite in `test.ts`. Tests are excluded from the extension build — they only run via this command.

### Type check

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Validates TypeScript types without producing any files. Useful for catching errors before building.

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Sync file manifest

```bash
npm run sync
# or: bun scripts/sync-pxt.ts
# or: npx tsx scripts/sync-pxt.ts
```

Scans `src/` and `test/` and updates the file lists in `pxt.json` automatically. Run this after adding, renaming, or deleting any `.ts` file — otherwise PXT won't pick up the change.

### Flash to micro:bit

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Requires a micro:bit connected via USB.

### Clean

```bash
make clean
```

---

### Load the built extension in MakeCode

After `npm run build`:

1. Go to [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/) and create a **New Project**
2. Click **Extensions** → **Import File**
3. Upload `built/binary.hex`

The Butia v4 blocks will appear in the block palette immediately.

> **Tip:** After each code change, run `npm run build` and re-import the `.hex` file to pick up your updates.

---

## Using the Extension via GitHub (Stable)

For classroom use or when you just want to use the extension without building from source:

1. Open [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
2. Click **New Project**
3. Go to ⚙ → **Extensions**
4. Search for or paste:
   ```
   https://github.com/butia4/butia-microbit-extension
   ```
5. Click **Import**

The extension is now ready to use in your project.

## Troubleshooting

### Blocks do not appear after importing the `.hex`

Make sure `pxt build` completed without errors. A build with TypeScript compilation errors may still produce a `.hex` that loads without exposing any blocks. Review the terminal output for error details before re-importing.
